        <p class="card-text">
            Stock trading involves buying and selling shares of companies in the stock market. 
            When you buy a stock, you are purchasing a small piece of ownership in a company. 
            The goal is to sell the stock later at a higher price to make a profit. However, 
            stock prices can fluctuate based on market conditions, company performance, and other factors.
